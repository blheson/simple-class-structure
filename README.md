# Folder Structure

# How to use
* Step 1 : Run ```composer init;composer install```
* Step 2 : Set Up Database connection in the ```Storage/DB.php``` file
* Step 3 : Create Controller and Model file based on each table in your database. ```Example.php``` has been set up as an example. Pun intended :)
* Step 4 : Include the following
```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            ...
            "Storage\\": "app/Storage/",
            "Middleware\\": "app/Middleware/",
            "Controller\\": "app/Controller/",

Where the key value represent the namespace for each class and the value represent the folder path to the 
* Step 5 : Run `composer dump-autoload`. This will auto generate an autoload file for all your classes.

# Note

For example, all class in the Controller folder must have Controller as the Namespace. Also, if a class is Posts, the name of the class should be Posts. Use `require "pathto/vendor/autoload.php"` to load in all classes into a file.
